# GeoPrism Registry Roadmap
{: .no_toc }


The GeoPrism Registry is designed and built by a community of partners. The roadmap is defined by a collective and evolving aggregation of input based on the needs of communities across countries. This roadmap is subject to change as it strive to outline the high level objectives as the need is better understood by the community over time.

## About


The roadmap outlines the key functionality that has been determined to be important functionality for the GeoPrism Registry. As usage is better understand the future roadmap goals may change. This is not an exhaustive list of all functionality in the GeoPrism Registry.

## Roadmap
- [x] Assign users to contributor, maintainer, or administrative roles within organizations.
- [x] Assign users to cross organization administrative roles.
- [x] Register and maintain organizations to support restricted data sharing within organizations as well as cross organization sharing.
- [x] Create and manage Geo-Object Types which define how data should be structured in the system.
- [x] Create and manage hierarchies which are composed of Geo-Object Types.
- [x] Integrate and store data through time.
- [x] Upload spreadsheets.
- [x] Upload shapefiles.
- [x] Manage Geo-Object position in hierarchies (e.g. parent / child relationships).
- [x] Assign data to be public or private (shared within an organization).
- [x] Publish data as lists.
- [x] Explore data through time on maps.
- [x] Submit data changes to a curation process.
- [x] Monitor and authorize changes submitted.
- [x] Access and manage tasks needing attention (e.g. a Geo-Object that needs to be assigned to a parent).
- [x] Access and manage system data from external application through API access.
- [x] Combine hierarchies to maximize data sharing and reduce duplication.
- [x] Push data to external DHIS2 or Reveal systems.
- [ ] DHIS2 plugin integration.
- [ ] DHIS2 Oauth integration.
- [ ] Set end dates for data integrated and stored over time.
- [ ] Specify (when uploading a shapefile) whether to import attributes only, geometry only, or both.
- [ ] Assign data (Geo-Objects, Geo-Object Types, Geo-Object Type attributes, hierarchies, and geometries) to be restricted which adds an additional privacy setting on top of public and private.
- [ ] Public or private privileges on Geo-Object Types.
- [ ] Improve time validity functionality for data integration procedures.
- [ ] Ability to assign Geo-Objects to grand parents.
- [ ] Ability to split a Geo-Object.
- [ ] Enhanced ability to edit geometry data for Geo-Objects.
- [ ] Enhanced ability to link Geo-Objects to derivative artifacts (lists, maps, etc...).
- [ ] Enhanced ability to visualize and manage data on a hierarchy graph.
