## About

The GeoPrism Registry is the first implementation of the [Common Geo-Registry (CGR) Specification](https://github.com/terraframe/common-geo-registry-specification). The CGR is a long term vision of Health GeoLab Collaborative and developed in partnership with Clinton Health Access Initiative, Vital Wave, and other [Digital Solutions For Malaria Elimination (DSME)](http://dsme.community/) community partners.

Development for the GeoPrism Registry began as one of the [DSME common goods](https://dsme.community/common-geo-registry/) which collectively strive to eliminate Malaria.

## Vision of the Common Geo-Registry (CGR)
The Common Geo-Registry (CGR), is an IT solution that provides a single source of truth for the standardization, management and use of geographic data over time. The CGR is used to store, manage and share information that is official and non-official and both current and historic in relation to geographic objects (Geo-Objects) key to the sustainable development of administrative divisions, villages, infrastructure and other relevant physical and virtual features in an environment. This information is stored as lists, hierarchies and geospatial data accessible by any information system or user with granted access rights.
